# water-quality
Public water systems and regulators in the US generate and publish a lot of information about drinking and ambient water quality, but it's not easy to use on a large scale. In this repository, I hope to develop tools that help researchers and citizens analyze water quality data. Some ideas for what this might include:
* Identify which public water system serves a given address
* Displaying where each water system's water is sourced from, as in the graphics in this <i>Tribune</i> article: http://graphics.chicagotribune.com/news/lake-michigan-drinking-water-rates/index.html
* Simplifying pulls for UCMR or regulated drinking water data from the EPA and other sources for many public water systems, or for long periods of time.
